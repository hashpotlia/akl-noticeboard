## Overview
AKL NoticeBoard is a modern, real-time communication and compliance platform designed for DCO AKL cluster management. It streamlines the distribution, acknowledgment, and tracking of critical company notices, ensuring operational transparency and accountability across all user roles.

## Key Features
- **Priority-Based Notices:** Supports Critical, High, Medium, and Low priority levels, each visually distinct.
- **Digital Acknowledgment:** Users can digitally acknowledge notices; acknowledgments are tracked per user for compliance.
- **Role-Based Access:** Distinct experiences for USER, MANAGER, and SUPER_ADMIN roles, with seamless portal switching and session management.
- **Smart Filtering & Search:** Filter by acknowledgment status, category, priority, and sort notices. Full-text search is available.
- **Category & Tagging:** Notices can be categorized (Safety, Operations, Policy, HR, etc.) and tagged for easy discovery.
- **Pinning & Expiry:** Important notices can be pinned; expired notices are visually de-emphasized.
- **Mobile-Responsive UI:** Fully responsive, accessible, and visually modern interface using Tailwind CSS.
- **PWA Support:** Offline access and installability via service worker and manifest.
- **Automated Testing:** Jest-based unit and integration tests for user portal features.
